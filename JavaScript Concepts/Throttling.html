    <!-- /**
    *Throttling ensures that a function is executed at a c
    onsistent interval, no matter how many times itâ€™s triggered.

    General Rule: Use throttle when you want the function to execute at a consistent rate (e.g., 
    every 200ms) while the event continues to be triggered. It's ideal for situations where you
     want to perform an action repeatedly, but not as frequently as the event itself is triggered.

    Scroll Events (Lazy Loading, Infinite Scrolling):
    Button Clicks (Rate Limiting):
    Real-Time Position Tracking (Mouse Movement, Dragging):
